### Microphone Access

When you first open the application, your browser will request microphone access permission. This is necessary for the tuner to detect the sound from your instrument. 

- Click "Allow" when prompted for microphone access
- Make sure your device's microphone is working properly
- For best results, use the tuner in a quiet environment

### Using the Tuner

1. Once microphone access is granted, the tuner will automatically begin detecting pitches
2. Play a note on your instrument
3. The display will show:
   - The detected note name
   - How far sharp or flat you are from the target pitch
   - A visual indicator showing your tuning accuracy

The tuner provides real-time feedback, allowing you to make precise adjustments to achieve perfect tuning. The closer you get to the correct pitch, the more centered the indicator will be.

## Tips for Accurate Tuning

- Keep your instrument close to your device's microphone
- Avoid background noise while tuning
- Play notes clearly and individually
- Wait for the reading to stabilize before making adjustments
